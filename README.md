## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Prosper Loan Dataset, which is Americaâ€™s lending platform.
his data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit history, payment information and other.
The major goals of this project are to investigate the numerous factors that influence borrower behavior and to gain insight into the interactions between various variables via the use of data visualizations and summary statistics.
Some of the items that am going to explore are

- States have the most and least number of borrowers 
- Reason for taking a loan 
- Loan period, Prosper rating and employment status
- Borrower per home owner an monthly income   
- Borrower per year distribution  
- Prosper Score versus different variables
- Interest Rate, Yield and Estimated Loss 
- Loan Category versus different variables 


 

## Summary of Findings
In the exploration, i found out cities with higher population is likely to have a larger number of loan borrowers,most of borrowers are employed and full-time and there is a strong Relationship between Credit Score and Prosper Score in that Higher Credit Score leads to a Higher Prosper Score.


## Key Insights for Presentation


One of the key insight is to know how are the loan borrowers are distributed amongst the state and if the populate affects the outcome. It has been noted states with larger populations has a tendency of borrowing in large numbers 
Another insight was to know why are borrower borrowing loans since it can show the state of people in a country.
